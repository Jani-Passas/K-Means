## K-means algorithm


#### Overview

You will need to input the number of data points, the number of clusters, the minimum value of the data, the maximum value of the data, and the threshold value. The algorithm will run the first time by showing all the iterations until the threshold value is reached which is done to show the user how this code works. Then the algorithm is run nine times and records the data from the trial with the best togetherness (lowest value). In order to advance through the code, you will need to close out of the figures that are displayed on the screen and after the iterations of the first run, all nine graphs are displayed and can be seen at once. At the end of the k-means code, a file will be created called ‘data.txt’ with the recorded data from the algorithm which only records the data of the trial run with the lowest togetherness value.
